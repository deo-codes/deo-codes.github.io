But unlike everyone else, He never grew out of wrestling. Drax is better known for his eerie, throat-stratching voice, which has a catchphase, "FEAR THE INSANITY". As far as in-ring style goes, Drax has that underdog persona that which droves LTW fans to love him more. No matter how much bumps and bruises he takes, he always comes back and put up a good match against anybody. Don't underestimate of the Master of the Yo-Yo!!  </p>

A rail of a man, most of his food is taken in liquid form leaving him an emaciated horror to look upon. Upon meeting Meat, sAIN'T endowed him with the power of the Black Rider known as Famine. His goal is to keep The RejecKts hungry for vengeance and destruction. You can purchase The RejecKts merchandise here at <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/rejeckts">TeeSpring.</a></p></p>

        <p>YankeeTDM first started wrestling when he was 16 years old. Born in Bayamon,Puerto Rico, he fell in love with wrestling at a young age. Coming from a family with a wrestling background, it was very easy for him to fall in love with the sport. Now he travels the east coast wrestling, training and doing what he loves. His wrestling style is very unique as he considers himself to be a free lance wrestler with a variety of moves on his arsenal like his suicide dive, moonsaults flips and many more. You don't want to miss this great talent.</p>

        <p>Avik Jaress did everything the Gods asked him to. He was promised riches and women and every single thing his heart had desired in what Valhalla was. But when he thought his time came; he had been lied to and not allowed into the heavens. Now that he’s stuck here roaming the earth he’s taking out his frustration and anger on any and everyone. I also included two pics. They aren’t great and I’m getting new ones once everything is open again.</p>
