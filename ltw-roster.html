                <p>James Hynes AKA "Medic" is known for helping people but isn't afraid to get down, dirty and bloody if the means are necessary. Watch his hardcore matches against "The Newsie" Mak Stevens and Damien Tamer and you know exactly why he means business in the business. After being betrayed by his cousin and former tag team partner Ace Marxman at Holiday Havoc 2020, Hynes is off to find his own path and his mission is to take down all comers. As well as taken down The Syndicate along side with the formation AirJay, Clarke Williams, and "The Newsie" Mak Stevens as part of the faction, The Uncharted. Throughout his luxurious career, Hynes wrestled different wrestling promotions like GTS Wrestling, Titan Championship Wrestling (TCW),SWF Wrestling, Pro-Wrestling After Dark, Stand-Alone Wrestling, and right here at LTW.</p>

He was a paper boy who got pushed around and abused physically and mentally until one day he snapped and learned from his abusers, that the only way to succeed in life was tearing others down along the way. He decided from that day forward he would no longer be that defenseless and weak little Newsie. He would in fact be the boss and master villain himself. Now establish a foundation, The Uncharted (along with James Hynes, Clarke Williams, and Will Powers), Newsie's mission is no doubt in mind to capturing golds in LTW. </p>

Many have tried to conquer this apex of primordial strength, but only a few have returned. Any even they were never the same. If this is the case, then this mountain of a man has more than earned his nom de guerre. His very prescence is to make even the most seasoned of wrestlers ponder if they will be the same when the bell rings a second time. Walking to the ring, fans can only look on in awe, while his opponent can only watch in horror, like an avalanche descending upon a small town. His fists are boulders. His stare is ice. His stomps are rock slides. Before the bell rings, his opponents can only ponder the words of Jane Austen:"What are men...to rocks and mountains?"</p>

Eris was always called that by those who saw her as different, including her own family… she then left everything she knew and went to find peace and happiness. Once she found it she began to embrace the nickname many called her and took control of herself. Eris now never backs down from a fight, she is always determined to not only come out top but to prove those who doubt her in the past and now wrong. Eris may be “Strange and Unusual” but she is a survivor and will continue to move on and prove she is no longer a second thought.</p>

            <p>They say that pressure is what forces change in nature. Turning items of seemingly little valuable to substances. this couldn't be truer of Ray Louis, who rose from obscurity, through numerous trials and tribulations, to become a true wrestling diamond. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Louis fought for everything: money and respect. But above all he fought for experience, knowing that each fight would make him stronger, faster, and wiser. Louis has transitioned from the fight scene to the wrestling ring, where his skills from the streets have helped him accure a winning record that few can touch. All the while showing that this diamond is as strong and polished as ever. In the games of life, sometimes you have to be cautious and play the hand life deals you. But when hard times and stacked odds make you what you are , there's no reason to play this game safe. The cards have been dealt. Place your bets. Because he's Ray F'n Louis, and he's all in! </p>

            <p>In the seas of endless time, there have been creatures that have made man tremble in fear.  However, there are very few creatures that were so powerful and malevolent, that even the gods trembled at their passing. The Behemoth was one such monster. A creature of such size and ferocity, that even divine beings would feel a cold chill run up their spines at its very presence. The Behemoth of Locked Target Wrestling and the Behemoth of the bible share many traits in common.  Both are larger than life. Both inspire fear in lesser men. Both are engines of ruin and havoc.  But there is one monumental difference: One is only legend. One is all too real.  Since debuting in LTW, this beast of a man has cut a swath of devastation through anyone and anything that has stood in his way. Very few unfortunate souls have had the courage to cross his path, and even fewer have been able to describe their encounter with him afterwards. Those who have felt his power and rage, seldom speak of their experience. It’s just to painful.  As his path of pain continues, and opponents continue to step into the ring with this depraved creature, one thing remains clear: The agony they are going to experience…is going to be nothing less than biblical. </p>

                <p>HOG spent his early life tending to the animals on the family farm. It was an idyllic life until his mother was killed in mysterious circumstances. These events left HOG damaged, deranged, and vicious. Discovered wearing the face of the family's prized pig, he was little more than a tool of unfocused destruction. He is a true path of destruction. If you get in his way, you will end up on your back with his finishing move, The Slip Drop. Hog has held titles everywhere, including here at LTW as a former Tag Team and 24/7 Champion. He has gone and is hungry for more. He is the one nobody wants and he likes it that way.</p>

As far as in-ring style goes, Drax has that underdog persona that which droves LTW fans to love him more. No matter how much bumps and bruises he takes, he always comes back and put up a good match against anybody. Don't underestimate of the Master of the Yo-Yo!!</p>
