        <p>His nickname "The Mouth" is self-explanatory. Mickey is the locker room's least favorite authority figure and part of LTW's vicious faction, The Syndicate, alongside with Charlie Bonifer, Harley T. Morris,  Chris Constantine, and Ace Marxman.  Mickey can be persuasive if you are reasonable with him. But if you don't like his authority, then he will bring his devilish persona that want to hate him even more, which by sending his henchman to do the reasoning for the locker room.  Just remember to never cross the boss!</p>

Drax is better known for his eerie, throat-stratching voice, which has a catchphase, "FEAR THE INSANITY". As far as in-ring style goes, Drax has that underdog persona that which droves LTW fans to love him more. No matter how much bumps and bruises he takes, he always comes back and put up a good match against anybody. Don't underestimate of the Master of the Yo-Yo!!  </p>

He is a true path of destruction. If you get in his way, you will end up on your back with his finishing move, The Slip Drop. Hog has held titles everywhere, including here at LTW as a former Tag Team and 24/7 Champion. He has gone and is hungry for more. He is the one nobody wants and he likes it that way.

        <h2 class="roster-name">Damien Tamer</h2>
	
        <p>Formally known as Blue Rayge, Damien Tamer has a new attitude of basically destroying his opponents and wanting gold. Now apart of the Syndicate's "biggest prospect", Tamer is more destructive and demeanor than he has ever been. No longer feel lost and  defeated like his other persona, Tamer is ready to attack and with his size, his opponents doesn't stand a chance of surviving in his matches. Similar to Issac Scythe, Damien is one of the rising stars in the company and has a record of defeating opponents who hsve been in the business longer than he has. Go look back at his hardcore match with James Hynes and "The Newsie" Mak Stevens, and you will see why he's takes no prisoners and bringing a "rayge of destruction."</p>
