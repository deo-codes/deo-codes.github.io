        <p>The love for professional wrestling is the reason Robbie got accepted to be general manager of LTW. He's coming in here to call it down the line. LTW deserves the best and you're looking at it. He's all nice and fair until you get on his bad side. And once his Sicilian comes out that's an indication that you're breaking his balls.

        <p>His nickname "The Mouth" is self-explanatory. Mickey is the locker room's least favorite authority figure and part of LTW's vicious faction, The Syndication, alongside with Charlie Bonifer, Chris Constantine, and Ace Marxman.  Mickey can be persuasive if you are reasonable with him. But if you don't like his authority, then he will bring his devilish persona that want to hate him even more, which by sending his henchman to do the reasoning for the locker room.  Just remember to never cross the boss!</p>

These events left HOG damaged, deranged, and vicious. Discovered wearing the face of the family's prized pig, he was little more than a tool of unfocused destruction. He is a true path of destruction. If you get in his way, you will end up on your back with his finishing move, The Slip Drop. Hog has held titles everywhere, including here at LTW as a former Tag Team and 24/7 Champion. He has gone and is hungry for more. He is the one nobody wants and he likes it that way.

        <p>Don't let his height fool you. He may be small , but he's dangerous!! Vinny Cenzo eat, sleeps, and breathes hardcore wrestling and when it comes to hardcore wrestling, there's no stopping him and his devious actions.

        <p>The nickname "The Godfather of Filth" says it all. Dirt Bag Dan is the most artistic wrestler in the Jersey Shore. When you put in the ring with anyone in the LTW locker, his tactics can be messy (No Pun Intended). Similar to wrestlers like Violence, Vinny Cenzo, and Charlie Bonifer, Dan has some hardcore mindset that droves the LTW audience wild with his tactics. Check out the images of him vs. Charlie Bonifer in the Hardcore match that took place in No Resolution 2020 and you will see why he is called The Dirtologist. </p>
